<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>These are listed roughly in chronological order (oldest at the top and newest at the bottom), because it would be impossible to sort in order of importance.</p>

<h2 id="sec-personal">Personal Acknowledgements</h2>

	<h3 id="personal-dina">Dina Kats</h3>

	<h3 id="personal-family">My Family: Lana Kats, Mark Kats, Ben Lerman, Danya Kostovetski, Lolya Kostovetskaia, Galya Kats, Dodya Kats, Mikhail Tsyrkin, Rakhil Tsyrkina, Irene Lerman, Eugene Lerman, Joanna McDonough, Bella Glozman, Edy Glozman, Emma Glozman, Kobe Glozman, Lena Tsyrkina, &#8230;</h3>

		<!-- Coming first, of course, is my family. My mom served as the ultimate motivation, as I have had my sights on out-publishing her from the moment I began my scientific journey. While I have managed to match her hoard of two publications, her dad (my namesake) will keep me busy for a long, long time, because he was constantly writing books and papers with mathematical formulae that I can’t even begin to understand.

		On a more serious note, my parents ran away from the Soviet Union to give me the freedom to study, work, and publish without having a second thought about my (or my family’s) safety. My parents spent months as street vendors in Italy before moving to the U.S. They came to Boston without knowing English and with only a small amount of money and belongings (although, no loans, unlike their U.S.-educated children). They worked as dishwashers, a pizza delivery man, and a lab tech, before finding their places and giving me the opportunity to follow my educational (and career) dreams without having to worry about where to live, what to eat, or how to survive the costs. My dad somehow survived residency as an International Medical Graduate with a newborn (me) at home, and my mom gave up her academic career to raise me. I’ll never thank them enough, but I will at least plaster their names everywhere I can.

		Thank you to my little sister for pushing me to give myself some credit for my work and for calling to check in on me when I was too overwhelmed to realize that I hadn’t called in a while. Even though she’s nine years younger than me, she’s my role model for being comfortable with who you are, and I will forever be impressed that she had the courage to tell our immigrant parents that she wants to be an artist and a teacher. -->

		<!-- Also, a very important thank you to my friend, Elena Stoeri-D’Arrigo, for going to The Ruderman Inclusion Summit with me, following me to the healthcare panel, and pushing me to go up to chat with Dr. Skotko. None of this incredible experience would have happened without you. -->

<h2 id="sec-professional">Professional Acknowledgements</h2>

	<h3 id="professional-hedstrom">Lizbeth Hedstrom (research mentor)</h3>

		<!-- I am incredibly grateful for the support I have received from Prof. Lizbeth Hedstrom, who welcomed me into her lab as a sophomore. Even though I made many “undergrad” mistakes by failing to think things through, she never seemed to doubt me, even when I lost confidence in myself. During my time in the lab, I have grown incredibly as a scientist, a learner, and a thinker, and I cannot thank Prof. Hedstrom enough for giving me this opportunity. -->

		<!-- Thank you to my undergraduate advisor, Dr. Lizbeth Hedstrom, and mentors, Dr. Deviprasad Gollapalli and Mr. Vincent Sutera, for giving me unfaltering support and for teaching me how to be a scientist. I spent three years in Dr. Hedstrom’s basic science lab, and unfortunately was not able to get meaningful results from my project, but the support I received, even in the absence of a tangible product, was incredible. I’d also like to mention my lab neighbor, Dr. Rory Coffey, for encouraging me to pick up a side-project that was purely computational and showed me how rewarding and challenging computer-based research could be. -->
	
	<h3 id="professional-gollapalli">Devi Gollapalli (research mentor)</h3>

		<!-- Thank you very much to Dr. Devi Gollapalli for mentoring me over the past two years. I am incredibly appreciative for him always keeping me grounded and making sure I under- stood every little detail of what was going on. He really pushed me to gain autonomy and to learn to troubleshoot by myself, but he was always available to answer all of my questions, or to simply chat about the Red Sox, Oklahoma, and many other random subjects. -->

	<h3 id="professional-sutera">Vincent Anthony Sutera (research mentor)</h3>

		<!-- Thank you to the Lovett Lab, specifically Vincent Sutera, Prof. Susan Lovett, and Cara Pina for teaching me everything I needed to know about microbiology and giving me access to the Lovett Lab’s E. coli strain library. I am incredibly grateful for the support I received from Vinny, no matter how many times I proved him wrong after saying “this has never failed”. -->

	<h3 id="professional-sutera">Rory Coffey (research colleague)</h3>

	<h3 id="professional-gullett">Heidi Gullett (clinical mentor)</h3>

		<!-- While Dr. Heidi Gullett wasn’t a research mentor to me, I do have to thank her for lighting my fire during my first year of school by labeling me a “change agent.” Dr. Gullett’s voice always pops into my head and pushes me to make the world a healthier place. She was also one of the first people to give me genuine confidence in myself as a doctor and to make me feel like I belonged alongside her in clinic. -->

	<h3 id="professional-tarabichi">Yasir Tarabichi (research mentor)</h3>

		<!-- Thank you, Dr. Tarabichi, for taking me in, always supporting me, and treating me like an equal. I made plenty of mistakes during my three years at Metro, but your response was always to pull up a chair and troubleshoot alongside me. No matter how long something took or how many mistakes I made, you never lost trust in my work, always asked me my opinions, and showed me that I matter. You pushed me to present at conferences, introduced me to big names, and integrated me into the Metro contingent. When we published, you always gave me more credit than (I think) I deserve. Even though my career choice is taking me far away from lung cancer, I really hope we can continue working together, because it’s been genuinely fun. -->

	<h3 id="professional-osborne">Alli Osborne (supervising resident)</h3>

	<h3 id="professional-skotko">Brian Skotko (research mentor)</h3>

		<!-- Thank you, Dr. Brian Skotko, for thinking it was perfectly reasonable for me to randomly walk up to you after a panel at a conference and ask to work with you during part of a research block. The two things that stuck out most to me when spending two months in your clinic were everyone’s bedside manner and how impactful your care is for your patients. On the research side, I really appreciate how much responsibility you’ve given me with conducting interviews and helping out with the Human Rights project. Of course, I’m also really grateful for your mentoring and advice, connecting me with Program Directors, and helping decide which programs are the best fit for me. I’m really excited to keep working together through residency and to see how we can “make tomorrow a little better than today.” And, of course, thanks to the whole Down syndrome team—Clo, Dominica, Amy, Barbara, Vasiliki, Dr. Santoro, and Ben—for welcoming me in, letting me blend into clinics, and being a really fun group to join. -->
