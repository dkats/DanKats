	<p><strong>Sexual Education</strong> with <strong>American Medical Women's Association</strong> and <strong>University Hospitals</strong> &mdash; 11/2017 to Present<br>
	Together with other medical students, I teach a three-day sexual education course in local Cleveland middle schools. Day&nbsp;1 focuses on anatomy, physiology, and puberty; day&nbsp;2 is about sexually transmitted infections; day 3&nbsp;covers birth control/contraception. While Ohio only requires an abstinence-only curriculum in its schools, we teach various methods of birth control and contraception, giving students more evidence-based knowledge to keep themselves safe.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.hungernetwork.org/?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1121">Stay Well Project</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.hungernetwork.org/">Hunger Network of Greater Cleveland</a>) &mdash; 3/2017 to Present<br>
	The Stay Well Project hosts many community-based programs with the goal of providing health information to under-resourced communities. In collaboration with pharmacy and nutrition students, we (medical students) operate several stations through which community members rotate through. We offer blood pressure, weight/BMI, and glucose screenings, in addition to help signing up for health insurance. Woven into these stations are opportunities for counseling on topics such as smoking cessation, weight management, exercise, proper diet, and diabetes management.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="http://www.circlehealthservices.org/">Student Run Health Clinic</a></strong> &mdash; Summer 2017 to Present<br>
	We work together with Social Work and Nursing students (and a physician or NP preceptor) to provide free healthcare (mainly STI screening/treatment and physicals) to underserved populations within the Greater Cleveland community. Medical students fill three <a href="https://srfc.case.edu/volunteers/students/">roles</a>: Case Manager (M1, M2, MN1, or MN2), Junior Clinician (M1, M2, MN1, or MN2), and Senior Clinician (M3, M4, or MSN). Teams (composed of one person in each of these roles, along with a Social Work student) work to first address social health needs (Case Manager and Social Work), followed by a clinical assessment (Junior and Senior Clinician) prior to being seen by the preceptor.</p>
