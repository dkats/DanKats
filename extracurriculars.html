<h1>Extracurriculars</h1>

<h2 id="commserv">Community Service</h2>

	<p><strong>Sexual Education at the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Detention Center</strong> &mdash; October 2017 to February 2018<br />
	Taught a three-day sexual education curriculum to children at the county juvenile detention center. Topics covered: reproductive anatomy, hygiene, sexually transmitted infections, contraception, consent, and healthy relationships.</p>

	<p><strong>Anatomy Camp</strong> &mdash; October -- November 2017<br />
	Taught Cleveland middle and high school students general principles of biology related to the healthcare field.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="http://www.circlehealthservices.org/">Student Run Health Clinic</a></strong> &mdash; Summer 2017 to Present<br />
	We work together with Social Work and Nursing students (and a physician or NP preceptor) to provide free healthcare (mainly STI screening/treatment and physicals) to underserved populations within the Greater Cleveland community. Medical students fill three <a href="https://srfc.case.edu/volunteers/students/">roles</a>: Case Manager (M1, M2, MN1, or MN2), Junior Clinician (M1, M2, MN1, or MN2), and Senior Clinician (M3, M4, or MSN). Teams (composed of one person in each of these roles, along with a Social Work student) work to first address social health needs (Case Manager and Social Work), followed by a clinical assessment (Junior and Senior Clinician) prior to being seen by the preceptor.</p>

	<p><strong>Doc Opera</strong> (Fundraiser) &mdash; August to December 2016, 2017<br />
	Doc Opera is a fundraiser for the Student Run Health Clinic and consists of dances and skits entirely performed by medical students. In 2016, I danced in three performances: cha-cha, Bollywood fusion, and hip-hop. In 2017, I was in a fusion dance consisting of Bhangra, Bharatanatyam, and Kathak (three Indian dance styles).</p>

	<p><strong>Sexual Education</strong> with <strong>American Medical Women's Association</strong> and <strong>University Hospitals</strong> &mdash; 11/2017 to Present<br />
	Together with other medical students, I teach a three-day sexual education course in local Cleveland middle schools. Day&nbsp;1 focuses on anatomy, physiology, and puberty; day&nbsp;2 is about sexually transmitted infections; day 3&nbsp;covers birth control/contraception. While Ohio only requires an abstinence-only curriculum in its schools, we teach various methods of birth control and contraception, giving students more evidence-based knowledge to keep themselves safe.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.hungernetwork.org/?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1121">Stay Well Project</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.hungernetwork.org/">Hunger Network of Greater Cleveland</a>) &mdash; 3/2017 to Present<br />
	The Stay Well Project hosts many community-based programs with the goal of providing health information to under-resourced communities. In collaboration with pharmacy and nutrition students, we (medical students) operate several stations through which community members rotate through. We offer blood pressure, weight/BMI, and glucose screenings, in addition to help signing up for health insurance. Woven into these stations are opportunities for counseling on topics such as smoking cessation, weight management, exercise, proper diet, and diabetes management.</p>

	<p><strong>SPECTRUM</strong> &mdash; September 2012 to May 2016<br />
	During my undergraduate education, I volunteered (Sept. 2012 to Nov. 2014) and coordinated (Nov. 2014 to May 2016) a community service group that ran weekly tutoring, mentoring, and playgroup (with parent social group) programs for children with (and without) developmental disabilities. We also planned and hosted annual educational events about developmental disabilities. I managed the nonprofit budget of over $6,000 and grew our volunteer base from thirty to sixty members.<br />
	Awards: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WSEPAC/home">Waltham Special Education Parent Advisory Council</a>'s Rising Star (2015) and Kelly Beaumont-Mazzarini Inclusion (2016) awards, <a href="http://www.gwarc.org/">Greater Waltham Arc</a>'s <a href="http://www.gwarc.org/newsdetail/annual-meeting-2015/">"Rags" LaCava Community Service Award (2015)</a>.</p>
