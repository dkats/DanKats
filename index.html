		<p>Obesity is a huge problem in the U.S., and I wanted to do something about it. I created a website to make it as easy as possible for people to exercise (i.e. at home, without any equipment other than a phone/computer to access the website). I work on making everything as easy as possible, as well as explaining everything (how I made the website, why I made it, etc.). My vision is for this to be used by pediatricians and PCPs to encourage their patients to be active. Ideally, the website explains everything, so the physician won't need to spend much time on this; just a quick plug/"prescription" and the patient can look into it on their own time.

		<p>A simple website for making pharmacology flashcards according to Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine's CASED Card format.
