<h1 id="current">Current Non-Research Projects</h1>

	<h2 id="KatsMD"><a href="https://www.katsmd.com/" target="_blank">KatsMD.com</a></h2>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">I created a clinical website with two purposes:</p>
		
		<ol style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 1em;">
			<li>(<a href="https://www.katsmd.com/info.html" target="_blank">KatsMD.com/info</a>) to provide my clinic patients with educational resources</li>
			<li>(<a href="https://www.katsmd.com/ref.html" target="_blank">KatsMD.com/ref</a>) to create a unified directory of clinical resources for myself (or other clinicians) to reference</li>
		</ol>

	<h2 id="Augmentin"><a href="https://www.amoxclav.com/" target="_blank">Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) Calculator</a></h2>

		<p>I, together with a Pediatric Pharmacist, created an online decision support tool to guide selection and dosing of the appropriate formulation of amoxicillin-clavulanate. The main question we answer is: "What ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate should I use?"</p>

<h1 id="advocacy">Advocacy</h1>

	<h2><a href="https://rfdash.weebly.com/">Residents And Fellows Day At The State House</a></h2>

		<p>RFDASH is an annual advocacy day hosted by the Massachusetts General Hospital <em>for</em> Children Pediatric Residency in which Massachusetts pediatric residents (with support from the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics) meet with state legislators to advocate for specific healthcare bills.</p>

		<h3>2022</h3>

			<p>I met with <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/PMO">Senator Patrick Oâ€™Connor (R; Plymouth and Norfolk counties)</a> to discuss An Act to Support Families (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H221">H.221</a>), An Act Relative to Vaccines and Preventing Future Disease Outbreaks (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/HD3992">H.2411</a>), and An Act Addressing Barriers to Care for Mental Health (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S1276">S.1276</a>/<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S2572">S.2572</a>).</p>

		<h3>2021</h3>

			<p>I met one-on-one with <a href="https://malegislature.gov/people/profile/j_l1">Representative Jay Livingstone (D; 8th Suffolk)</a> to discuss An Act to Ensure Equitable Health Coverage for All Children (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S762">S.762</a>/<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H1309">H.1309</a>), An Act Relative to Healthy Youth (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S318">S.318</a>/<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/HD3454">H.673</a>), and An Act Relative to Transparency in Behavioral Health Boarding (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H203">H.203</a>).</p>

<h1 id="past">Past Projects</h1>

	<h2 id="infusion-calc"><a href="https://dkats.github.io/InfusionCalc/" target="_blank">Infusion Calculator</a></h2>

		<p>I, together with a Pediatric Pharmacist, created an online calculator to double-check nurses'/pharmacists' calculations for how to properly (according to the Massachusetts General Hospital protocol) up-titrate the infusions of IV immunoglobulin and rituximab.</p>

	<h2 id="DrDANce"><a href="https://dkats.github.io/DrDANce/" target="_blank">Dr. DANce</a></h2>

		<p>Obesity is a huge problem in the U.S., and I wanted to do something about it. I created a website to make it as easy as possible for people to exercise (i.e. at home, without any equipment other than a phone/computer to access the website). I work on making everything as easy as possible, as well as explaining everything (how I made the website, why I made it, etc.). My vision is for this to be used by pediatricians and PCPs to encourage their patients to be active. Ideally, the website explains everything, so the physician won't need to spend much time on this; just a quick plug/"prescription" and the patient can look into it on their own time.</p>

	<h2 id="sexed"><a href="https://www.katsmd.com/sexed" target="_blank">Sex Education Website</a></h2>

		<p>I am creating a sex education website that I could give to my patients to augment what we talk about during our clinic visits. The goal is <em>not</em> to create a comprehensive curriculum, but rather to create lists of high quality resources so that kids (and parents) know where to go for answers.</p>

	<h2 id="ipop"><a href="https://www.katsmd.com/ipop" target="_blank">MGH Interpreter Service Phone Tree Navigator</a></h2>

		<p>I created a website to generate QR codes that would dial MGH Interpreter Services and would automatically navigate the phone tree to dial the patient's language, MRN, location in the hopsital, etc. The QR codes could be printed and posted at patients' bedsides to speed up the process of dialing for an interpreter to less than 30 seconds.</p>

	<h2 id="ExerTimes">ExerTimes</h2>

		<p>NOT YET FUNCTIONAL, but it will be a simple workout timer that guides you through your workout!</p>

	<h2 id="casedcards"><a href="https://dkats.github.io/CASEDCards/" target="_blank">CASED Cards</a></h2>

		<p>A simple website for making pharmacology flashcards according to Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine's CASED Card format.</p>
