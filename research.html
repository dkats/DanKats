<h1>Research</h1>

<h2 id="currinterests">Current Interests</h2>

	<p>Currently, I am interested in working with electronic medical records (EMR). There are two main ways in which I would like to explore EMR: firstly, using "big data" to look for previously invisible trends and patterns; and secondly, optimizing the way in which EMR can be used to make healthcare <em>safe</em> for patients and to <em>help</em> healthcare providers deliver the best care possible.</p>

	<p>EMR provides an immense, yet structured, mass of data that is begging to be analyzed in ways that were not possible with paper charts. Processing information from thousands, tens of thousands, or even more patients is limited only by computer power, which cannot compare to the previously used method of medical student chart review. However, with great data comes great responsibility; that is, the new challenge is to what is <em>useful</em> and <em>actionable</em>. EMR-based research meshes perfectly with my love of computers and math, and I have begun to enter the informatics space, which will hopefully join me throughout my career.</p>

	<p>While the concept of EMR was originally developed with a business purpose, it is an amazing opportunity to make healthcare workers' lives easier. While some have developed a hate of EMR and claim to prefer paper charts, I see this as a repairable fault of specific EMR systems; there is no reason why computers cannot surpass the utility of paper. While I currently do not have a plan for improving EMR to better interact with healthcare providers, I will look to move into this space in the future. My first goal will be to make strides towards interoperability, that is, the ability of different EMRs to work together and share information. I believe that without interoperability, true patient safety is not possible, and this is a pressing, yet easily fixable (in terms of technical complexity) issue.</p>

	<p>Undergraduate Thesis – high honors: <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10192/32359" target="_blank">"Inosine 5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase: A collection of mysterious binding sites and regulation"</a> (embargoed until summer 2018)</p>

	<blockquote><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is the rate-determining step of the guanine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway, is a target for anticancer, antibiotic, antiviral, and immunosuppressant drug development. Additionally, mutations in human IMPDH are correlated to inherited retinal degeneration. Previously, we discovered binding interactions between IMPDH and both ribosome and RNA polymerase in <em>Escherichia coli</em>. I designed several chromosomal IMPDH mutants to disrupt the binding between IMPDH and ribosome in order to locate the binding site. To increase the physiological relevance of this project, I began creating a collection of chromosomal IMPDH mutants, rather than using a plasmid-based approach. Future experiments will use affinity chromatography to purify selected mutant IMPDHs and check them for disruption of the interactions with RNA polymerase or ribosome. I have also developed several Python files to process IC<sub>50</sub> data, producing a variety of visual and analytical interpretations of the data. One of the scripts takes in large IC<sub>50</sub> data sets of inhibitors with enzymes from various species, and finds the minimal set of inhibitors needed to maintain the original hierarchical structure among the enzymes. My collection of five scripts allows investigators to process data sets within minutes that would have otherwise taken days or weeks to complete, or would not have been practical to attempt at all.</blockquote>
