<h1>My Reflections on Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine (2016&ndash;2020)</h1>

	<p>Disclaimer: This is based on my experiences, so take everything with a grain of salt. Experiences vary among classmates and the curriculum may have changed since I was a student.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

	<h3>Biggest Pros</h3>

		<p>For me, the biggest selling point were the people (both classmates and faculty). We're very collaborative (because the pre-clinical years are pass/fail), so there's lots of sharing and working together. Of course, there are also students who have a dog-eat-dog mentality, but there's very few of them relative to the others. And the really flexible scheduling made it really easy to volunteer and do research.</p>

		<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hgullett">Dr. Heidi Gullett</a> is easily the best professor that I've had and is just an amazing human being. She teaches the public health curriculum, which is the first month of med school, and she started an awesome pre-clinical elective in which we were assigned to be patient navigators for either a group of patients at the VA or a family of refugees. Halfway through my <em>first</em> year, I was assigned to a family of refugees. My job was to shadow them to all of their appointments, call them between appointments just to check in, and keep their PCP up to date. It was by far the best thing that I did in all of med school for my education. Not only did a learn about social determinants of health, but I <em>saw</em> them.</p>

	<h3>Biggest Cons</h3>

		<p>For me (and I stress that this is highly personal), Cleveland was not a great fit. I'm from the Boston area and didn't realize how much of a New Englander I am until I moved to Cleveland (I had lived within 40 minutes of Boston for my entire life before med school). The culture/people are different, the land is flat (nowhere to ski or hike), and my family and friends were far away.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>

	<p>The curriculum is relatively flexible, both in terms of time and students having influence to add elements.</p>

	<p>During the pre-clinical years, lectures/organized sessions are only in the mornings (8am to noon) and Thursdays are entirely review (optional). This leaves <em>tons</em> of time for research, shadowing, volunteering, or anything else (including self-care and exercise)!</p>

	<p>In terms of adding new elements to the curriculum, there are usually plenty of faculty willing to help come up with new things. That being said, it's pretty hard to add things, because something would have to be removed. So, most additions are extracurricular lectures, which is great and easy to schedule with all of the free time we have, but attendance is lower.</p>

	<h3>Interdisciplinary education</h3>

		<p>Interdisciplinary work is a major thing that's missing (at least during 2016&ndash;2018). They've been trying to integrate it more and more, and the brand new med school building has the MD, PA, RN, and dentistry schools all under one roof, so that should help. I'm not sure what exactly is going on, but the <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/admissions-programs/md-programs/contact-md-programs">Admissions people</a> could fill you in on the newer changes.</p>

<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>

	<h3>Research</h3>

		<p>We're the only med school in town and there are four hospitals (Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, MetroHealth, and the VA), so there are lots and lots of research opportunities. I had two different research projects going on during school, but some of my classmates even had three PIs, because there are way more attendings than med students.</p>

		<p>My experience with attendings has been incredibly positive, but even if a PI isn't the best fit, it's really easy to try something new.</p>

	<h3>Community Service</h3>

		<p>There are <em>lots</em> of community service opportunities. Admittedly, most are medicine-focused, but you can still find a wide range of opportunities. If something that you're interested doesn't exist, it's really easy to get a new group started, and there are loads of faculty that will help guide you.</p>

		<p>My favorites were teaching sex ed at middle schools and the juvenile detention center, dancing in our annual variety show (a fundraiser for the free clinic), and hosting high schoolers for mini-med school sessions. This is definitely a strength for Case, because the pre-clinical lectures are 8am-noon, so it's really easy to find/make time to volunteer.</p>
