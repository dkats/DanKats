<h1>My Reflections on Peds Residency at Massachusetts General Hospital <em>for</em> Children (2020&ndash;2023)</h1>

	<p>First of all, let me start by saying that there is no such thing as a ~perfect~ program. There are programs that are great fits for you and programs that are not great fits for you. That being said, MGH<em>f</em>C happens to be a great fit for me, and I hope that this page will help you decide whether it would also be a great fit for you!</p>

	<p><u>Disclaimer:</u> This is based on solely <em>my</em> experiences, so take everything with a grain of salt.</p>

	<p><u>Conflicts of Interest:</u> No one other than me has written or edited any of what I have to say. There was <em>zero</em> input from my program leadership; they did not ask me to write this and did not know about it until I posted it on Twitter. I decided to do this because 1) I genuinely love it here and 2) this interview season is incredibly difficult for applicants to figure out how programs <em>feel</em>.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

	<h3>Biggest Pros</h3>

		<p><strong>The people!! &ndash;</strong> The environment here is super warm, fuzzy, and family-like. <em>Everyone</em> is here to help and answer questions, even if they're super busy. We're on a first name basis with almost all of the attendings, and it's not at all intimidating to ask them questions. No matter how basic the question, I've never felt judged or like I was being a nuisance. During my first shift in the ED, I was there with a Junior resident, and she answered a non-stop barrage of questions from me and constantly checked in throughout the shift to make sure that I was comfortable with everything going on. During my Cardiology elective, I asked loads of questions in the middle of packed clinics, and the attendings went into super thorough impromptu teaching sessions with hand-drawn pictures and heart models to make sure that I understood everything going on.</p>

		<p><strong>Support during difficult times &ndash;</strong> During the first month of intern year, a patient of mine died (they were on hospice, so it wasn't unexpected, but any time a child dies is difficult to process). Let me tell you, the response from everyone around me could <em>not</em> have been any better. The day before my patient died (as we realized that end of life was near), the Chiefs all magically appeared throughout the day to check in on me. My Senior resident let me skip rounds to be at my dying patient's bedside, and called me over to quickly present my other patients when the time came (although she also offered to present my other patients for me). The Chiefs let me skip our mandatory conferences to stay at bedside. After my patient died, my Junior resident made me hand over my pager and took the other intern's pager. She told us to leave for an <em>hour</em>, even though it was nearing sign-out time. While I was gone, the palliative care NP had done all of my paperwork for me (the death certificate, calling the organ bank, and calling the medical examiner's office). Afterwards, we had <em>two</em> optional debriefing meetings (one a few days later and one a week later) to give us time to reflect on caring for the patient. If I could give just one piece of advice to applicants, it would be this: <u>ask residents how their programs respond to patient deaths</u>. No other time will make programs <em>show</em> how much they care about their residents.</p>

		<p><strong>Relaxed environment within a powerhouse hospital &ndash;</strong> I'm not going to pretend that MGH<em>f</em>C is some super high-ranking pediatrics program; we're not, and I'm sure that you all have searched the rankings. That being said, I've never felt like I'm missing out on any education, interesting patients, or research opportunities. If anything, I appreciate the calm, relaxed environment that we have without pressure from maintaining a ranking. At the same time, we have loads of benefits from being within a big name hospital: the research opportunities are literally endless and the community views us to be just as trustworthy as the adult sides of MGH. For what it's worth, I have a list of 13 interesting patients from the first 6 weeks of residency, even though our volume has been down in the setting of COVID-19.</p>

	<h3>Biggest Cons</h3>

		<p><strong>Cost of living in Boston &ndash;</strong> Living in Boston is <em>not</em> cheap. That being said, our salary is definitely enough to live comfortably. I'm pushing it a bit financially, but I live by myself in a one bedroom apartment (with an extra office!) that's a three minute walk from the hospital. Also, you get what you pay for and Boston is an <em>amazing</em> place to live (in my pretty biased opinion as a New Englander who came running back to Boston and is planning to never ever leave again).</p>

		<p><strong>Hospital food &ndash;</strong> I'm not a fan of the food in the MGH cafeteria; it's not awful, just nothing to write home about. One of the nice perks is that the wards teams are provided bagels every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning and lunch from local restaurants every day of the week (a rotating cycle of: Indian, Italian, pizza, Thai, and Mediterranean).</p>

<h2>Other Notes</h2>

	<h3>Patient Population</h3>

		<p>We're not a public safety-net hospital. That being said, MGH<em>f</em>C has a much more diverse patient population than the adult side of the hospital. We see plenty of vulnerable patient populations, including those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged or require an interpreter. During my ED shifts, I use an interpreter for 1&ndash;3 patients (out of the ~8 that I see over a shift); on the floor, it's about the same.</p>

	<h3>Response to George Floyd's Death</h3>

		<p>George Floyd was killed before residency started for me, so I didn't experience the immediate aftermath in the hospital. I was, however, around for the systemic responses afterwards. Here's an incomplete list of the communication that was sent out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>5/29/20: Email from the MGH President, Mass General Physician Organization CEO, and MGH Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer</li>
			<li>6/4/20: Email from the MGH President and Mass General Physician Organization CEO forwarding a letter from the MGH CMO, Mass General Physician Organization CMO, MGH SVP of Human Resources, MGH Anesthetist in Chief, MGH SVP of Network Development and Integration, MGH Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer, MGH Founding Director of the Center for Diversity & Inclusion, and MGH Chief of Staff to MGH President</li>
			<li>6/9/20: Email from the MGH Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer, MGH President, and Mass General Physician Organization CEO saying that a plan for action is being developed and asking for feedback through an online portal</li>
			<li>6/18/20: Email from the MGH Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer, MGH President, and Mass General Physician Organization CEO announcing a Juneteeth celebration, which included a keynote by author, professor, and NYT contributor, Dr. Hasan Jeffries, an hour with Front Porch Collective, a Black theatre company in Boston, and 30 minutes with LaShyra Nolen, Harvard Medical Schoolâ€™s first Black woman class president.</li>
			<li>6/28/20: A draft of the new MGH Structural Equity 10-Point Plan was revealed during a town hall</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mgh_wc4bl/?hl=en">MGH chapter</a> of White Coats for Black Lives was formed with residents from at least Psychiatry, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics. We created a list of bold demands for the administration and presented them in person. We were working on these demands off the radar when the administration opened channels for feedback and input. We presented our demands to them on 6/12/20. Since then, several subcommittees of MGH WC4BL have been formed and continue to work.</p>

	<h3>Program Leadership</h3>

		<p>This was my very first interaction with my (future) Program Director:</p>
		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Always interested in talking with students headed to peds, especially primary care! DM if you&#39;re ever interested.</p>&mdash; Shannon Scott-Vernaglia, MD (@ScottVernaglia) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottVernaglia/status/1121234452213055488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		<p>I was an MS3 taking part in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MedHumChat/status/1121219898431156225?s=20">medical humanities chat on Twitter</a> and I mentioned that the outpatient part of my peds clerkship wasn't as great as I hoped it would be. I emailed Shannon and she ended up chatting with me over the phone for a half-hour. Keep in mind that I was some totally random med student from Twitter; there was zero reason for her to give me that much guidance and attention. During that conversation, she gave me an incredible piece of advice that I carried with me through the rest of medical school: <q>Don't worry about becoming a pediatrician during your fourth year. That's what residency is for.</q></p>

		<p>My first interaction with one of the APDs, Kate Sparger, was also as a MS3. I was at the end of a research rotation that I did in the MGH Down Syndrome Program, and we met to chat about the program because I was starting to think about residency applications. The memorable part was that Kate (a NICU attending) was called to a C-section 5 minutes after we sat down, so I got to see my first C-section (this was before my Ob/Gyn rotation). Talk about an exciting introduction...</p>

		<p>On interview day, I opened my folder in the morning and found a <em>hand-written</em> note from Shannon welcoming me back (I had done a sub-I in the PICU during my fourth year of med school). She normally <em>hand-writes</em> notes to <em>every</em> applicant (even those who had not been to MGH<em>f</em>C before). Can you imagine the amount of time this takes??</p>

	<h3>Wellness</h3>

		<p><strong>Tummy Time &ndash;</strong> The current Junior class started a tradition of "Tummy Time", which is what they called the resident happy hour. There's a standing happy hour every week, but obviously this has changed a bit during COVID-19. We (the current Intern class) have our own Tummy Time when we hang out (socially distanced) on the docks on the Charles River a few minutes from the hospital. I'm not sure what will happen when the weather gets colder, but I'm sure we'll figure it out.</p>

		<p><strong>Errands and doctor appointments &ndash;</strong> Our schedules are perfect for running errands and making doctor's appointments! We spend lots of time in the ED, where shifts tend to be in the afternoons, and we average four shifts per week, so there's plenty of time to go to the doctor (or do other errands). Some programs have dedicated self-care time, but we rely on our ED blocks to give us that free time. During my first few months of intern year, I've established care with a new PCP, gone to the dentist, and have seen two specialists without any scheduling issues. As a side note, we also have great health insurance; we're self-insured, so we can see anyone within the Mass General Brigham system.</p>
